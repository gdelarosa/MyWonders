# MyWonders
My Wonders App uses Core Data to store photos and video of places you've discovered. Once saved, you may edit and modify each post. The app integrates the use of MapKit, CoreLocation, AVFoundation, and MobileCoreServices. 

*Update for 8/5/16 - 1. Fixed UIButton bugs on View Wonder view controller by adjusting the autolayout and updating the button with an image. Need to fix button on edit wonders and crash when selecting photos button. 

*This is a continous project. Expected to complete by 8/20/16
