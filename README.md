# MyWonders
My Wonders App uses Core Data to store photos and video of places you've discovered. Once saved, you may edit and modify each post. The app integrates the use of MapKit, CoreLocation, AVFoundation, and MobileCoreServices. 

*Update for 8/6/16 -  1. Need to fix button on edit wonders and crash when selecting photos button.
2. Added camera capability for user to upload picture from camera. 

*This is a continous project. Expected to complete by 8/20/16
